I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything

    bio: "Hello! I'm Mohamed. I'm a finance expert for Cofidis. I've been working for this company since 2018. I graduated as a bachelor in Engineering Sciences majored in Civil Engineering and then pursued a Master degree in Computer Science (CompSci) and Management at UMons Faculty of Engineering (FPMs). Then I studied Management Engineering at UMons Warocqu√© School of Business and Economics (FWEG). This year, I went back to FPMs to complete this Master in CompSci. I enjoy being by myself. I love taking a long walk with a book and looking at the sea, the moon and the sky.",
